## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

## The challenge

The challenge was to  build out this profile card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Building the project

I applied the following topics to build this project:

1. Project structure. To organize the assets, html and css components in pieces located in a logical structure.
2. Visual Studio Code editing capabilities for HTML, CSS with aid of extensions like Prettier, and Bracket Pair Colorizer and using [keyboard shortcuts for Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf).
3. CSS files separated for each group of devices (mobile, tablet and desktop) based on media queries. Deliberately, I didn't include any media query for a particular device but you can find details [here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/)
4. Layouts and alignment based mainly on CSS Flexbox.
5. Use of external fonts based in Google fonts and imported in html for better performance.
6. I learned how to add multiple backround images with CSS. Great article in [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/css-basics-using-multiple-backgrounds/).
7. Adjusting images to container with CSS [overflow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow) and [object fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) properties.

Other learnings associated to this project:
- Using Windows Subsystem Linux v2 for deploying Ubuntu 20.04 as deployment environment
- Installing, configuring and Microsoft Terminal.
- Installing oh-my-zsh with personalized appearence.
- Git commands for stage, commit and push to remote in Github

## Deploying the project

The project is deployed in [Vercel](https://frontend-mentor-profile-card-component-eta-gold.vercel.app/) synced from GitHub repository. CI/CD basics applied here.
